                <h3>Background:</h3>
                <p>Hello! My name is Josh Kimbel and I am a 30-year-old Student at Kennesaw State University and I am currently employed at the University Of Georgia as a Systems Administrator.  I have been with the University for almost 10 years and hold several different roles in IT that I will elaborate on further in the experiences section below. Besides my professional background, I have been married to a wonderful woman for going on 4 years and we have been together for almost 7 years. We share one child our son Hudson and he is the light of my world. He turned 2 in February of this year (2024) and is a loving, rambunctious, playful kid. My wife and I are planning on buying our first house in the next couple of months together and plan to expand our family after we get moved into our new home.<p/>
                <h3>Experiences:</h3>
                <p>I started my working at BestBuy as a seasonal worker in 2013 with their mobile sales department. I quickly was added to their full-time staff after showing them my work ethic and the talent I had to offer. My dream at that time was to work in the Computer department as computers were my true passion. Just a few short months after becoming full-time with BestBuy in Mobile Sales the store's Microsoft representative opened up and I was promoted to that position. In that position, I was the highest-rated Microsoft Sales representative in the southeast and closed multiple $100K sales. This put me on a fast track to a management position with BestBuy and when the next one opened up I was promoted. I moved over to Home Theater Lead in the middle of 2014 leading my department to be the highest-selling department in the region. A few months later I received a call from one of my best friends who worked at UGA if wanted to come work for him. It was a tough decision because I would be taking a pay cut and I would only be hired as a temporary worker with no promise of moving to a full-time position if I could not prove myself. I prayed about it for a few days to see if I should leave my secure job as a Home Theater Lead and move to this new job at UGA. Ultimately I decided moving to this new position would be the best thing for me, my career, and my future family.  I started working at UGA  on September 8th, 2014 as a temporary helpdesk worker. After a few months, my bosses must have liked me they decided to keep me around and promote me to Helpdesk Manager on May 1st, 2015. I worked in that position for roughly 2 years until I was promoted to Network Administrator Assistant. During this time I was working on my Associates Degree at Athens Technical College. After obtaining my degree I worked in that position for roughly another 2 years when I was promoted to a full Network Administrator. During this time my Wife was pregnant with my Son and I knew then when she became pregnant I needed to go back to school to get my bachelor's Degree and I am still working on my education as of today. About a year after my Son was born in 2022 I was promoted to System Administrator and that is the current role I hold. I still have a lot to learn but I am working hard to master this role and move into my next position as a System Administrator Manager directly reporting to the IT Director for my department at UGA. I would not be where I am today without my Mom, Wife, Son, and my friend that took a chance on me and taught me everything I know about the IT world.   </p>
